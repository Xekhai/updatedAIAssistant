## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official website if you don't already have them.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Xekhai/updatedAIAssistant.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```
cd updatedAIAssistant
```

3. Install the project dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key
```
5. Start the development server

```
node index.js
```

The app will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customization
Here are some additional tips and tricks to further enhance your chatbot:

- Personalize your chatbot: Use the information about your users to personalize the responses your chatbot provides. This could be anything from their name to their location.
- Keep your chatbot focused: Determine what the purpose of your chatbot is, and stick to it. Keep your chatbot's responses concise and relevant to the conversation.
- Add additional functionality: Consider integrating other APIs or services into your chatbot to add additional functionality. For example, you could use the Google Maps API to provide directions or the Stripe API to allow users to make payments within the chatbot.
- Test and iterate: Don't be afraid to test your chatbot with real users and iterate based on their feedback. This will help you improve the overall user experience and ensure that your chatbot is meeting its intended purpose.
